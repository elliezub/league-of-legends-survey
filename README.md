# League of Legends Survey
My first freeCodeCamp project, the first project in the Responsive Web Design Certification series.

I decided to create a survey asking various questions aimed at people who play League of Legends. Since it is a game I really enjoy playing, I thought it would be a good idea for my first official project. 

If there are any changes that you see could be made please let me know! I am a beginner so I am definitely open to constructive criticism. ðŸ˜Š
